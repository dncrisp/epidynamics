% WS_FOCUS_r0p4_bifcurves_and_statespace contains the bifurcation curves 
% and state space for the unfolding of the deg. TB singularity, focus case
% with R=0.4 and b=1, obtained using Matcont and CL_Matcont.
% Frequency and amplitude are computed from simulations with tmax=3000 and 
% threshold 2500 (tstep=0.1).
% See Saggio et al. 2017 for details

% The unfolding can be plotted using plot_unfolding.m
